All the below are biobrick plasmids. The Cam resistance plasmids are parts that are biobricked for use in Bsubtilis. It is said that Bsubtilis is
relativity codon neutral, meaning it will likely express any CDS that E coli will. However, this does not mean that RBSs are compatible. To 
combat this I am creating a library of 16 RBSs produced by the Salis lab RBS calculator. After these are constructed, I am going to test 16
additional RBSs to get a large range. Finally, I will test 16 native RBS sites with RFP and GFP to get exact numbers for gene

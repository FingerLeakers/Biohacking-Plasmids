All the below are biobrick plasmids. The Cam resistance plasmids are parts that are biobricked for use in Bsubtilis. It is said that Bsubtilis is
relativity codon neutral, meaning it will likely express any CDS that E coli will. However, this does not mean that RBSs are compatible. I am
creating a library of RBSs but it'll take some time for it to be done.

(those are accession numbers for the Bacillus genetic stock center, look them up. They're very nice)

If you want any of my plasmids, give me a heads up. I am creating new ones all the time, and will try and keep this updated. I'll send 1ml 
bacterial cultures to you for like 5 bucks each or a plasmid trade. Thanks!
